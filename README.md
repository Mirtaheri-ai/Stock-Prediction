# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for **time series forecasting** in stock market analysis. By analyzing historical stock price data, the project aims to provide accurate predictions of future stock trends, enabling data-driven investment decisions and risk management strategies.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Data Pipeline
- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values.
  - Normalization of data for improved model performance.
  - Feature engineering with technical indicators such as Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Descriptive statistics.
  - Time series visualization for trend and seasonality analysis.

### 2. Advanced Deep Learning Model
- **LSTM Architecture:**
  - Multi-layered LSTM model designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.
  - Customizable hyperparameters for experimentation.
- **Training and Optimization:**
  - Efficient model training with techniques to avoid overfitting.
  - Tuning for optimal performance on prediction tasks.

### 3. Performance Evaluation
- Key metrics for evaluation:
  - **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)
  - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
  - **R² Score**
- Visual comparisons of actual vs. predicted stock prices.

### 4. Interactive Visualizations
- Graphical representations of:
  - Trends and patterns in historical data.
  - Model predictions and their accuracy.

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare the Dataset
- Ensure the dataset includes historical stock prices with features such as Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.
- Add technical indicators as needed.

### Step 2: Train the Model
Run the training script to train the LSTM model:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Step 3: Evaluate the Model
After training, evaluate the model's performance:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

### Step 4: Visualize Predictions
Generate interactive visualizations for predictions:
```bash
python visualize.py
```
